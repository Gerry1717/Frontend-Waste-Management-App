# Front End Mobile app in React-Native for Andrios and IOS

Food Waste is bas so heres an app to help control and track the items within your fridge controlled from a smartphone app food can be added by scanning the products barcode or manually for loose items without a ISBN or similar barcode.

The frontend should consist of a form which allows the user to input a food item name
which is then checked against a dictionary and the user told if it is, or is not, found in the
dictionary.

# Basic workflows:
Recording expiry dates:
a) Food item is scanned through the scanner machine attached to the refrigerator.
b) The scanner machine records the expiry date and sends it to the backend cloud
service.
c) The backend cloud service stores the item name, quantity, and expiry date in a
database.
Retrieving expiry dates:
a) User interacts with the app and wants to check list of food items in the refrigerator
along with their expiry dates.
b) The app sends user request to the backend cloud service, which stores the expiry
dates of all the items in a database.
c) The backend cloud service runs a query in its database and returns the requested
results to the app.
d) The app displays the results.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
